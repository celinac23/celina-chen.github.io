Hi! I’m **Yufei (Celina) Chen**, an undergraduate student at the **University of Toronto** pursuing a Computer Science Specialist degree and an undergraduate researcher at the **Vector Institute**.

I am broadly interested in **machine learning**, with particular focus on:

- Differential privacy  
- Machine unlearning  
- Data preprocessing  
- Representation learning  

### Current work
I am currently an undergraduate researcher advised by **Professor Nicolas Papernot**. My research examines how models can be adapted under data scarcity and sensitivity, particularly when retraining is constrained by privacy or uneven data availability. One line of my work studies **differentially private data mixing**, where mixtures of public datasets are learned to compensate for limited private data without consuming additional privacy budget. In parallel, I explore **machine unlearning under data scarcity**, investigating whether principled data reweighting can restore long-tailed structure and improve stability during unlearning.

Alongside this work, I am interested in **representation learning and interpretability**, with a focus on how internal representations shape model behavior after training. I am currently investigating **model merging through representation alignment**, studying when and how aligning internal feature spaces improves mergeability and preserves task-specific structure. A brief summary of my current progress can be found **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16BTpnh2UPe-qD-gg4SZcvCQVvmtWgZ_b/view?usp=sharing)**.

### Education
- **University of Toronto**  
  B.Sc. (Undergraduate), Computer Science Specialist  
  Expected graduation: 2026
